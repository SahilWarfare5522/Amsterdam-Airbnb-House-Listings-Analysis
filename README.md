## 📊 Assignment Part I – Tableau Dashboards

As a data analyst at Airbnb, you're tasked with exploring the landscape of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam. You are expected to create **two interactive dashboards** in Tableau:

### 🔹 Overview Dashboard I
This dashboard provides an overview of listings for selected neighborhoods. It includes:
- 📍 Map chart showing all listings
- 📊 Summary metrics: number of listings, reviews, average rating, and average price
- 🛏️ Room type distribution
- <img width="634" height="517" alt="Picture1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0827402-0f02-4300-b329-74b5c0e77cd0" />


### 🔹 Overview Dashboard II
This dashboard provides deeper insights into the listing characteristics:
- 📈 Growth of Airbnb listings over the years
- 🧑‍💼 Overview of top hosts
- 💰 Price distribution by room types
- <img width="750" height="610" alt="Picture2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bb8fd83-561d-4760-94a6-6f55f92f035a" />

> 📌 All charts must follow best practices in data visualization including proper labeling, consistent color usage, and interactivity.

## 🐍 Assignment Part II – Python Analysis

You’ll dive into the same Amsterdam listings dataset to perform deeper exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn).

Key steps include:
- Reading and understanding the dataset
- Performing EDA tasks like null value analysis, distribution plots, trends
